# blockchain
I didn't get the blockchain hype. So I decided to build a Bitcoin based on its underlying intuitions, while trying to break it at every stage.

Now, I'm somewhat convinced, but cautious.

### If you'd like to toy with this code yourself:

**You're absolutely free to download and mess with this code in any way you'd like.** The file you're looking for is 'crypto_sandbox.py', which can be run on its own, or along with the 'ledger.csv' file. Or, you could just download the whole folder.

I reserve no rights on any of the content in this repository.

### Implementing the code, if you're using Python for the first time:

I think I've designed the file simply enough, such that you don't need coding experience to tinker with it. There's really only three or four things you could alter on that file anyway. But if you're using Python for the first time, you will need to do a few rather complicated things.

*First, you need to install Python.* This is a liiiittle more complicated than your usual installation. You can start from the official Python downloads page (just search 'python [your OS: windows/mac/linux but if you used linux why are you reading this]'). But if you get stuck, check out this excellent guide on what to do next: https://realpython.com/installing-python/

*Next, you need to install the 'project dependencies'.* Namely, the pandas module. If you downloaded an IDE (essentially, smart software that makes coding easy; I recommend PyCharm), it's super easy. But if you didn't, you may want to reference this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7225900/how-can-i-install-packages-using-pip-according-to-the-requirements-txt-file-from

Once you do that, just open the file, run it, and the rest should be straightforward. Have fun!

## Context to this project

This project was inspired by this absolutely phenomenal video by 3Blue1Brown: https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4

In the video, 3Blue1Brown builds up the intuition of a blockchain from the idea of sharing a 'ledger' with some friends. The underlying thrust of it is that the ledger system moves from one involving trust in the users, to trust in the ledger-holder, and eventually, to trust in the system itself. I cannot stress how good of a video this is.

Yet, after watching the video and many others, I still did not understand (and have not understood) why the 'blockchain' idea was touted as such a revolutionary and ground-breaking one. In particular, I read and heard a lot about how blockchain-based solutions might be useful as solutions to problems facing digital markets and cybersecurity. I mean, I get the intuition of a blockchain. But I don't know if it's really worth its hype.

So that's the idea of this project. By following the process suggested by the 3Blue1Brown video, and by trying to break my system at every stage, I want to understand what makes blockchains that great. My main hope is to leave with a stronger understanding of how great blockchains are, but I also hope to share this experience with others who might be interested in the technical nuts and bolts of blockchains.

Quick disclaimer: I am an amateur programmer at best. My main occupation is being a law student, which means I'm more comfortable with long chunks of words than short fragments of code. It also explains why my comments and explanations are so long-winded (sorry about that!). But I took on this project because I had heard lots of legal musings on the future of crypto and blockchain applications, without any real understanding of what those things were. I certainly have a better understanding of it now. You can expect to see a more 'legal' blog post coming out in a bit.

But with that out of the way, hope this project may be informative for you! Or, at the very least, I hope my inefficient programming and poor mastery of pandas may elicit some laughs.

### Some awesome resources which really helped me along the way

The Bitcoin paper, which I don't fully understand but am trying my best to crack: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

A great YouTube explainer on the context of coin mining on the blockchain: https://youtu.be/kZXXDp0_R-w

The only reason I understand what proof-of-work is (and even then, I'm still not 100% sure): https://youtu.be/XLcWy1uV8YM

Maybe my next project: https://youtu.be/M3EFi_POhps
