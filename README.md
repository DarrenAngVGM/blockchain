# blockchain
I don't get the blockchain hype. So I decided to build a Bitcoin and try to break it. Maybe I'll be convinced.

This project was inspired by this absolutely phenomenal video by 3Blue1Brown: https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4

In the video, 3Blue1Brown builds up the intuition of a blockchain from the idea of sharing a 'ledger' with some friends. The underlying thrust of it is that the ledger system moves from one involving trust in the users, to trust in the ledger-holder, and eventually, to trust in the system itself. I cannot stress how good of a video this is.

Yet, after watching the video and many others, I still did not understand (and have not understood) why the 'blockchain' idea is touted as such a revolutionary and ground-breaking one. In particular, I read and heard a lot about how blockchain-based solutions might be useful as solutions to problems facing digital markets and cybersecurity. I mean, I get the intuition of a blockchain. But I don't know if it's really worth its hype.

So that's the idea of this project. By following the process suggested by the 3Blue1Brown video, and by trying to break my system at every stage, I want to understand what makes blockchains that great. My main hope is to leave with a stronger understanding of how great blockchains are, but I also hope to share this experience with others who might be interested in the technical nuts and bolts of blockchains.

Hope this project may be informative for you! Or, at the very least, I hope my inefficient programming and poor mastery of pandas may elicit some laughs.
