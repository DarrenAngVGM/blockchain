    "While stuck in a short self-isolation period, I decided to finally try to understand how a cryptocurrency works. And there's no better way to understand how it works then to, well, *actually program it*. So here we are.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was extremely inspired by the excellent explanation given in this 3Blue1Brown video: https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4. For the most part, I'm following along with the video's structure, though I did check out a bunch of other videos along the way for more specific topics (namely, proof-of-work). \n",
    "\n",
    "The code isn't that great, but I think it works well enough to construct the intuition of crypto from the bottom up. The aim of this little project was to illuminate my own understanding of blockchains, and I hope it may illuminate yours as well; so to that end, I'd just like to emphasise that **you do not need to know how to code for this to make sense**. I hope I've written it clearly enough for those who haven't had my privilege of learning coding. You don't really need to look at the code blocks; it should be okay to focus on the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: The code I'm displaying here is significantly reduced from the one I actually tinkered with. It omits some tangentially-important components of crypto systems, like the private and public key system, as well as user authentication.

    "Now, some people say that crypto is 'trustless'. If 'trustless' means you don't have to trust a central governing authority, then I'd say it's 99.9% correct. But if it means you don't have to trust anything at all, then it'd be flat-out wrong.\n",

    "Because in a crypto system, you still need to 'trust' something. You need to trust the crypto system.\n",

    "So here's how we'll construct the intuition of crypto: we'll take a journey that begins from trust in your friends, to trusting a central authority, to trusting a network of users, and finally, to trusting in computational effort. It might sound abstract now. I assure you it'll make more sense as we go along."

    "### That's cool, but why would I want to use a hash function like SHA256? \n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of a hash is two-fold. First, it's very easy to verify if your input data is legitimate. Think of our earlier 'wassup_yall' example: the only way I could get the hash output of 'ba7672e97fb2aa5ff3fbcb3bef3aee96002540884886d6670f4622647e4995da' is by keying in 'wassup_yall'. Exactly. Even 'wassup yall' without the underscore wasn't okay. So if you keyed in input data the first time and got the hash, and you keyed in something to get the hash again, I can be pretty sure you keyed in the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the flip-side to that is that, even if I know you keyed in the same input, I can't easily determine the exact data you inputted. I mean, could you identify 'wassup_yall' from the string 'ba7672e97fb2aa5ff3fbcb3bef3aee96002540884886d6670f4622647e4995da'?. Probably not. Which means, **if you were given a hash output and asked to find the input data, your best option is to guess until you get it right.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we call SHA256 a 'cryptographic hash function', and say that it only operates in one-way. Apparently this has never been tested, but I'd love to see someone try.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what is the purpose of a cryptographic hash function in a cryptocurrency? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in order to move beyond trust in the network of users, we need a way to ensure that genuine ledgers get accepted, while tampered ledgers get rejected. This has to be entirely outside of the users' control.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cryptographic hash function ensures this in really complicated ways, and the prevailing method is that of 'proof-of-work'. We'll get to that in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now, we need to explain how we get from the ledger to hash outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hashing the data in 'blocks' on the ledger\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by breaking up the ledger into **'blocks' of data**. Each 'block' will then be fed into the cryptographic hash function. This means that any tampered versions of that same block will yield a completely different output hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned above, we'll treat each transaction as its own 'block' for the purposes of this explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it's easier to use the code to demonstrate how the 'blocks' get hashed, and why that's useful. I'll just cook up a simple hash function that runs two values through SHA256: the transaction number and the payment amount. Again, the only important part is the output hash, below the code."

    "That's why we need to slow people like Blue down, and trust that there's no opportunity for these kinds of ledger attacks to happen. That's the place of the proof-of-work concept. And that's the final piece of our puzzle, at least for today.\n",

    "The timings and number of guesses required will change every time, so it's best if you tried to play with this yourself on your own Python console. But what's really clear to me is, **as I increase the difficulty of the SHA256 puzzle, the amount of time required to brute force guess the nonce increases exponentially.**\n",

    "So that's all you really need to do to slow down the 51% attackers! If they want to gain 51% control over the ledgers, they also need to perform the guesswork required to verify those fraudulent transactions. Some people have crunched the numbers for the amount of computational power (i.e. computers, electricity, etc.) you'd need to do that, and it's astronomical.\n",

    "Interestingly, doing this also allows Bitcoin to control the supply of their currency; as the amount of cryptocurrency increases, the difficulty can be quite easily increased by changing the number of zeroes required. It's probably more robust than just changing zeroes, but hey, the zeroes system works. "

    "\n",
    "It was easy to implement, the SHA256 puzzles worked really well, and honestly, I think I have a better understanding of why people think these cryptocurrencies aren't just a hoax. There's good reason for the hype around cryptocurrencies to exist: the technology really is quite amazing.\n",

    "But of course, that's the technology in itself. In reality, cryptocurrencies are (currently) extremely volatile investments that haven't been well-received by most governments. There are a bunch of broader reasons for that: their security lets them be used for crime financing, their ease of creation makes it such that there's loads of cryptocurrencies competing with one another, and their freedom from government control also means that it's really hard for governments to deal with crypto frauds. Not to forget the damage to the environment caused by crypto mining.\n",

This has wasted tons of electricity, and created loads of wasteful heat that gets dissipated into the environment.
