The problem:
The blockchain is [1, 41, 37].
The users' private and public keys are {'A': (1597390601, 1), 'B': (3811818608, 2), 'C': (3528218693, 3)}.

This hash is quite easy to break. I can just key in any 10 digit number that sums up correctly. Because no one transacts
more than once, there's no need to find a consistent private key yet. I can just add things to the ledger without
truly guessing the private keys.

It gets harder when there's more transactions. Next step is to implement a system that requires the private keys to
be the same, without any knowledge of the private key.
